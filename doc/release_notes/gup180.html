<h2 align="center">GUISDAP 1.80</h2>

<p>The <b>EISCAT GUISDAP vs 1.80</b>, is available for
<a href=dist180/>download</a>.
All lagged eros3 experiments should now be
analysable by GUISDAP, as well as the historic ones in KST and ESR.
However, there have been numerous changes and upgrades compared the old
<a href=gup165.html>1.65</a> version, so maybe one might need to
reinitialise some of the old experiments to get the analysis going.
The GUISDAP released here should not be confused with other versions
released at other sites.
It has succesfully been run on solaris8 (Forte6) and linux2.4 (gcc-2.96)
systems running matlab6.5.
The release has not been extensively tested so the found bugs
and/or shortcomings should be reported to 
<a href="../people.cgi?Ingemar+Häggström">me</a>. Also, I welcome
contributions as I do not have time to go through all things.
 
<h3>New Features</h3>

Proper handling of the remote data, so now analysis of ungated lagprofiles are possible.
There is a global variable <i>a_Offsetppd</i> to fine tune the actual time
offset between the transmitting and receiving site.
The old, only usable for Doppler,
way of doing it is still there, but it is recommended to
reinitialise the historic experiments to take advantage of the new development.
<p>
Firred alternating code experiments (e.g. arc). The <i>COR_arclp</i> routine
handles these and other types of firred codes.
<p>
Pulse-to-pulse code experiments (e.g. dlayer). The <i>COR_pulsetopulse</i>
routine handles these and the blocked lags.
<p>
The mex routines are based on the GULIPS package.
<p>
The apriori values are taken from an ionospheric model.
Included are the model first released in guisdap 1.50
('gup150') and the guisdap 1.65 GIVEME summer 1996 model ('giveme'). 
Since these are both static, a more general time-location dependent
option is now supplied, where
the IRI-2001 model is used ('iri'). At places where the IRI is not
available the model is extrapolated exept for temperatures below 120 km where
the MSIS model is called. The mex routines for these are included, but the
models are not. Every institute of class should already have these libraries.
The model used is chosen by the global variable <i>iono_model</i>. 
A user can easily supply his own model by naming it ionomodel_<i>name</i>.m.
<p>
Now mixtures of hydrogen and oxygen ions for the high
altitudes are allowed. In fact any number of ions species with different masses.
<p>
Composition fits is now possible, with any number of ions at selected altitudes.
This means that the result data vector, <i>r_param</i>, is somewhat different
from previous versions. The composition results are stored in field 6 and up.
<p>
Easy definable height regions for fitting of different parameters. The global
variable <i>fit_altitude</i> defines the start and stop altitude for fitting
the parameters (Ne,Ti,Te/Ti,Coll,Vi,p).
<p>
Each experiment has a default analysis definition, <i>ana_def.m</i>, defining
altitudes and parameters to fit.
<p>
Several minor changes: cleaning ups, no special ESR/KST, residual improvement,
speeding up by setting apriori errors=0,...

<h3>Plans for the next release</h3>

The pulse-to-pulse routine can be made much faster and simplier, by doing
some strategic changes in the deep guisdap routines. Now the initialisation
for dlayer takes many hours and the file is a few GB. The present routine is
correct, but is not for practical use except for the old GEN-11 maybe.
<p>
A quick-fit routine is on the way, which should speed up the analysis and
be less sensitive to different models used.
