Guisdap 9.2

This release of guisdap contains new features and bugfixes, but everything is made compatible
with older versions (hopefully). The package should be compatible with not too ancient Matlab
versions (>2016), but there may (or may not) be some problems on specific platforms.
Install

Guisdap-9.2 has been succesfully installed on linux. The software is available as a git repository,
https://gitlab.com/eiscat/guisdap9, or as precompiled precompiled packages,
https://cloud.eiscat.se/s/XGm8jnePJWCwP3A. For best performance it's adviced to compile the git scripts:

cd into the guisdap directory
 . ./libinstall.sh
make a link of bin/guisdap to a place on your path (ex /usr/local/bin)

Provided is a searchpath to ~/gup/mygup where your personal and edited distribution files should go.

Running

On a unix system prompt, type "guisdap --help" to see all the switches available. Normal analysis
is done running "guisdap -a" which will bring up a window with some entries to fill in. (Hopefully
selfexplained) This is the same as "guisdap" and then "analyse". When finished hit "GO". A more
detailed instruction can be found at here.There is also a course presentation describing how to
initialise new experiments and some useful tips on more specialised analysis. The initialisation
scripts are avaiable with "guisdap -i".
For Windows there is a startup script windows_start.m available that should be chosen as 'Run'
with right-click.

New features

With version 9.2 the new HDF5 format for the result data is introduced.
* There is a comprehensive document descriping the format: share/doc/pdf/EISCAT_Hdf5_data_format.pdf
* There is a quicklook spreadsheet file for the format: matfiles/Guisdap_Parameters.xlsx
* More rawdata taking experiments have been prepared for automatic lagprofiling and analysis
* mainly to get sub-dump resolutions of data
* The libraries have been rewritten to allow more compilers and be more matlab independent
* Mex routines are now optional
