GUISDAP 8.7

This release of guisdap contains a few new features and bugfixes, but
everything is made compatible with older versions (hopefully). The package
should be compatible with Matlab versions higher then 6.5, but there may (or
may not) be some problems on specific platforms.

Install

Guisdap-8.7 has been succesfully installed on linux. Other architectures may
have to change the makefiles, if speed is desired, othervise it should run
without the compiled routines.
On Windows systems it is recommended to run under the cygwin
environment for best compabilitiy. Please report any changes needed for any
systems.

untar the distribution at your favourite place
cd into the guisdap directory
if you want the speed improvements the mex utility provides:
 make "lib" and "mex7" (or "mex6") directories
 cd models/iri2007
 "make" (should be gnu-make)
 cd ../nrlmsise00
 "make"
 cd ../onera
 make OS=... ENV=... all
 cd ../../mexsources
 "make"

make a link of bin/guisdap to a place on your path (ex /usr/local/bin)

Provided is a searchpath to ~/gup/mygup where your personal and edited
distribution files should go.

Running

At the prompt, type "guisdap --help" to see all the switches available. Normal
analysis is done running "guisdap -a" which will bring up a window with some
entries to fill in. (Hopefully selfexplained) This is the same as "guisdap" and
then "analyse". When finished hit "GO". A more detailed instruction can be found
at http://www.eiscat.se/raw/GUISDAP/doc/howto.html.

There is also a course presentation describing how to initialise new experiments
and some useful tips on more specialised analysis in the EISCAT web site. The
initialisation scripts are avaiable with "guisdap -i".

New features

* To get raw density values also using nonzero lag profiles a parameter
  analysis_ppshortlags have been added. The value is default set to 1 on some
  experiments, but can be adjusted. The value sets how far out in the lag to go.
  To separate the different power profiles in the result file, the parameter
  r_ppw, specifying the range resolution, can be used.
* For experiments with transmitter samples on UHF and ESR, the phasepushing of
  the klystrons is calculated and taken into account of. For remote sites and
  experiments without defined transmitter samples after 1 January 2009 a default
  value of -21 Hz is used. One can adjust the value manually with the
  a_phasepush parameter.
* A summary plot for the plasmalines is added. First one need to integrate the
  data with guisdap, either via the d_saveint.dir parameter specifying the
  directory where to save it or 'AUTO', or set the analysis_plasmaline flag for
  faster handling of the data. The plot is then issued with
  'plasma_summary directory' command in the matlab window.
* There are of course numerous hidden improvements and refinements
  - new magic constants
  - option to save forward acfs
  - intro to plasmaline analysis
  - got back simulation (not fully)
  - make dirty variances for single dumps
  - fixes for new vs of matlab and madrigal
  - fixes for non integer samplings
  - specifying 32bit ints in library interfaces
  - updates from IRI
  - ...
