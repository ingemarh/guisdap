GUISDAP 8.1

This release is essentially version 1.81, but since the layout have changed
by going to anal and init directories, we have chosen to remove the "1"
from the version number. Also there are already a couple of "vs 2."
releases which are from a different tree, so by making a jump like this
these should be easier kept apart.

INSTALL
Guisdap-8.1 should be a lot more easy to install than previous versions.
It has been succesfully installed on solaris (Forte 6.2) and linux (gcc 3).
For solaris there are some problems with <matlab6.5 and Forte7, so try to
avoid those. Other architectures may have to change the makefiles.
Guisdap itself have been made as little unix-dependent as possible and
might run even on PC-windows. Please report any changes needed for other
systems.

untar the distribution at your favourite place
cd into the guisdap directory
if you want the speed improvements the mex utility provides:
 make "lib" and "mex6" directories
 cd models/iri2001
 "make" (should be gnu-make) and "make install"
 cd ../nrlmsise00
 "make" and "make install"
 cd ../../mexsources
 "make"
othervise things are almost the same (but slower)
make a link of /.../guisdap/bin/guisdap into a place on
   your path (ex /usr/local/bin)
Provided are also a searchpath to $HOME/gup/mygup/ into which your personal
files should go.

Running

Running analysis is also a lot simplier.
At the prompt, type "guisdap --help" to see all the switches available.
Normal analysis is done running "guisdap -a" which will bring up a
window with some entries to fill in. (Hopefully selfexplained)
This is the same as "guisdap" and then "analyse". When finished hit "GO".

As usual, you are on your own initialising experiments. If someone writes
or have a manual for this, I gladly debug and include it. In any case,
the initialisation scripts are avaiable with "guisdap -i".

New features

-Fitting is done on the logs of the parameters instead of the parameters
 themselves to aviod any normalisation factors (d(log(N))=dN/N).
-The famous "vizu" plotting are included.
-Integration is done best using the Nigel Wade integration package, but
 the built-in integration have been improved to screen on antenna and
 transmitter status.
-The latest changes on the parameter block is taken into account.
-"Forcing" parameters is made easier by the "f_" switch (ex. f_ch_Pt=1e6;
 forces the tx power to 1MW)
-NCAR results files are switched on by NCAR=1,2,3 (bitpattern: 1=ascii,
 2=binary)
-The IRI and MSIS models are included as the interfaces depends on the
 model verions
-Numerous hidden improvements and refinements
