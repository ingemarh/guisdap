GUISDAP 8.5

This release of guisdap contains several new features and bugfixes,
but everything is made compatible with older versions (hopefully).
The package should be compatible with Matlab versions higher then 6.5,
but there may (or may not) be some problems on specific platforms.

Install
Guisdap-8.5 has been succesfully installed on Solaris and
linux, and the makefiles are written for those systems.
Other architectures may have to change the makefiles, if you want speed,
othervise it should run without the compiled routines. On Windows
systems it is recommended to run under the cygwin environment for
best compabilitiy.
Please report any changes needed for other systems.

untar the distribution at your favourite place
cd into the guisdap directory
if you want the speed improvements the mex utility provides:
 make "lib" and "mex7" (or "mex6") directories
 cd models/iri2001
 "make" (should be gnu-make)
 cd ../nrlmsise00
 "make"
 cd ../../mexsources
 "make"
make a link of bin/guisdap to a place on your path (ex /usr/local/bin)

Integration of historic KST data (not .mat format) is done using the
Nigel Wade integration
package which you have to install separately. Provided are paths to
NW/mex6 for the mex files and NW/lib for the libraries.

Provided is also a searchpath to ~/gup/mygup where your personal
and edited distribution files should go.

Running

At the prompt, type "guisdap --help" to see all the switches available.
Normal analysis is done running "guisdap -a" which will bring up a
window with some entries to fill in. (Hopefully selfexplained)
This is the same as "guisdap" and then "analyse". When finished hit "GO".
A more detailed instruction can be found pressing the '?' button.

New features

For experiments with multiple versions, such as manda and steffe, GUISDAP now
accepts them with the same name. If the automatic version selection fails the
initialisation to choose can be controlled by the analysis_rcprog parameter.
Analysis on the web directly from our data base follows more or less the
gfd setup. With that one does not need to download massive amounts of raw data
and a matlab license or a guisdap installation. Also the running version of
GUISDAP is used with the latest enhancements. The result files, plots and
outputs are sent to the given email.
Satellite checking has been improved to cut out the affected ranges instead of
skipping the whole preintegrated dump. This feature is the default on some
experiments and can be controlled by the boolean a_satch.cut.
Short lags can be used for the raw density estimates via the tuning parameter
analysis_ppshortlags.
The matlab result files also includes range resolution, r_w. Added to the power
profiles are range and statistical resolutions, r_ppw and r_pperr. A signature,
name_sig, shows on what machine and when the analysis were made.
The fit_altitude parameter have been extended to also control the physical
limits for the parameters and how each parameter are fitted, linearly or
logaritmic or hyperbolic.

-Numerous improvements and refinements
 Back to individual freq/channel properties
 Redone gaincurve
 d_saveint is now a struct: .dir as before, .var for saving variances or not
 Display also satellite position, longer timeout in RT
 Introduce a_intfixforce
 Get max vizu dy from resolutions
 Landscape vizu plot
 New renderer for calib_pl_ne
 Show plasma line spec in calibration
 Use waveguide power for VHF from 2007 default
 Better control of pp handling
 Added taro beataT, enabling vc's without transmission
 Adding site=P + steffe_P
 Display the used analysis parameters with display_analysis_pars
