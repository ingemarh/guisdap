GUISDAP 9.0

This release of guisdap contains a few new features and bugfixes, but
everything is made compatible with older versions (hopefully). The package
should be compatible with not too ancient Matlab versions (>2013), but there may (or
may not) be some problems on specific platforms.

Install

Guisdap-9.0 has been succesfully installed on linux. Other architectures may
have to change the makefiles, if speed is desired, othervise it should run
without the compiled routines.
On Windows systems it is recommended to run under the cygwin
environment for best compabilitiy. Please report any changes needed for any
systems.

untar the distribution at your favourite place
cd into the guisdap directory
if you want the speed improvements the mex utility provides:
 make "lib" and "mex7" directories
 cd models/iri2016
 "make" (should be gnu-make)
 cd ../nrlmsise00
 "make"
 cd ../irbem
 make OS=... ENV=... all
 cd ../../mexsources
 "make"

make a link of bin/guisdap to a place on your path (ex /usr/local/bin)

Provided is a searchpath to ~/gup/mygup where your personal and edited
distribution files should go.

Running

At the prompt, type "guisdap --help" to see all the switches available. Normal
analysis is done running "guisdap -a" which will bring up a window with some
entries to fill in. (Hopefully selfexplained) This is the same as "guisdap" and
then "analyse". When finished hit "GO". A more detailed instruction can be found
at http://www.eiscat.se/raw/GUISDAP/doc/howto.html.

There is also a course presentation describing how to initialise new experiments
and some useful tips on more specialised analysis in the EISCAT web site. The
initialisation scripts are avaiable with "guisdap -i".

New features

With version 9 there are provisions for analysing raw voltage data.

* The most common EISCAT dsp routines are included, and on some expeiments
  there are wrappers to control the lagprofiling processing via the
  analysis_lagprofiling parameter:
*   analysis_lagprofiling.par  The control parameter list, normally static
*   analysis_lagprofiling.data Start address to insert the results
*   analysis_lagprofiling.raw  Start address for the raw data
*   analysis_lagprofiling.do   Do or don't lagprofile
*   analysis_lagprofiling.lib  Dsp routine to use
*   Some generic names for the wrapping:
*     analysis_lagprofiling.nsamp No raw samples per scan
*     analysis_lagprofiling.nrep No repititions
*     analysis_lagprofiling.nwin No windows (codes)
*     analysis_lagprofiling.wlen Window length
*     analysis_lagprofiling.p    [First last] profile to process
