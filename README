Guisdap 10.0

This release of guisdap contains new features and bugfixes, but everything is
made compatible with older versions (hopefully). The package should be
compatible with not too ancient Matlab versions (>2023), but there may (or may
not) be some problems on specific platforms.

Install

Guisdap-10.0 is more-or-less platform independent, and is running on
Linux/iOS/Windows. The software is available in
https://github.com/ingemarh/guisdap, either as a git repository or ready made
deb packages,
deb [trusted=yes] https://sourceforge.net/projects/guisdap/files/deb-repo/ bookworm main
The libraries contain up-to-date ionospheric, atmospheric and magnetic models
and can either be installed as the .deb repo (libguisdap) , or made optimised
for the hardware/software (tested on Linux and iOS) via ./libinstall.sh
Guisdap is then started via bin/guisdap (preferrably linked to a place on the
path).
Provided is a searchpath to ~/gup/mygup where your personal and edited
distribution files may go not to interfere with the distributed files.

Running

On a unix system prompt, type guisdap --help to see all the switches available.
Normal analysis is done running guisdap -a which will bring up a window with
some entries to fill in. (Hopefully selfexplained) This is the same as guisdap
and then analyse. When finished hit GO. A more detailed instruction can be
found at here. There is also a course presentation describing how to initialise
new experiments and some useful tips on more specialised analysis. The
initialisation scripts are avaiable with guisdap -i.
For Windows there is a startup script guisdap.m available that should be chosen
as 'Run' with right-click.
An updated Guisdap is also included in the nirithil/etools docker.
