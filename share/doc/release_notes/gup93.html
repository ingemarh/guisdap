<h1>Guisdap 9.3</h1>
This release of guisdap contains new features and bugfixes, but everything is made compatible with older versions (hopefully). The package should be compatible with not too ancient Matlab versions (>2020), but there may (or may not) be some problems on specific platforms.
<h2>Install</h2>
Guisdap-9.3 is more-or-less platform independent, and is running on Linux/iOS/Windows. The software is available in
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/guisdap">https://sourceforge.net/projects/guisdap</a>, 
either as a git repository or ready made deb packages, <b>deb [trusted=yes] https://sourceforge.net/projects/guisdap/files/deb-repo/ bookworm main</b>.
The libraries contain up-to-date ionospheric, atmospheric and magntetic models and can either
be installed as the .deb repo (libguisdap)
, or made optimised for the hardware/software (tested on Linux
and iOS) via <b>./libinstall.sh </b><br>
Guisdap is then started via bin/guisdap (preferrably linked to a place on the path).<br>
Provided is a searchpath to ~/gup/mygup where your personal and edited distribution files may go
not to interfere with the distributed files.

<h2>Running</h2>
On a Unix system prompt, type <b>guisdap -h</b> to see all the switches available. Normal analysis is done running <b>guisdap -a</b> which will bring up a window with some entries to fill in. (Hopefully selfexplained) This is the same as <b>guisdap</b> and then <b>analyse</b>. When finished hit <b>GO</b>. A more detailed instruction can be found at <a href="https://www.eiscat.se/document/user-documentation/guisdap8-for-dummies/">here</a>.There is also a course <a href="https://www.eiscat.se/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/GUISDAP.pdf">presentation</a> describing how to initialise new experiments and some useful tips on more specialised analysis. The initialisation scripts are avaiable with <b>guisdap -i</b>.
<br>
For Windows or Matlab desktop there is a startup script <code>guisdap.m</code> available.
<br>
An updated Guisdap is also included in the <b>nirithil/etools</b> docker.
